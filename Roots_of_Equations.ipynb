    "**BISECTION METHOD**\n",
    "\n",
    "This code implements the bisection method, a numerical technique for finding roots of a continuous function by repeatedly halving an interval where the function changes sign. The user provides the lower and upper bounds, and the function $$f(x) = x^2 - 10$$ is evaluated at those points to ensure a root exists between them. The algorithm then iteratively computes the midpoint, checks which sub-interval contains the sign change, and updates the bounds accordingly. This process continues until the difference between successive midpoints is smaller than the specified error tolerance, at which point the midpoint is taken as the approximate root."
